# Browser-Automation-Whatsapp-using-Python
## Project by [Hitik Saini](https://hitik20.tech/)
This is a simple demonstration of using python in automation of browser and sending messages in bulk all at once in a single click.

## Dependencies
You will need to download Chrome Webdriver for this to work. After downloading install it and copy it to C:// then pass the path to python and follow my code,
(remember this is a critical process make sure you do all things correctly)

## How it works?
I have explained what to do in the comments of the .py code.
Also, don't forget to install selenium into your python interpreter(eg. jupyter notebook)
if you need any help feel free to contact.
Good luck.
